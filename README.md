Stretch RE1 is a robot developed by hello robot inc, and is used by this lab at UMass to help in nursing. From simple motion to picking things up and mapping paths around a room, this robot is very versatile in how it can be used in the medical field to help with simple tasks. 

I have developed code using the stretch_body API in Python that will take keyboard input and move different parts of Stretch. It is simple in design and easy to understand, and runs with ROS Melodic in a Linux environment. Everything required for it is in this repository. 

Coming soon: image capture, autonomous code, and more details on them.
